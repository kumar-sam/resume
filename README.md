# Resume Sanjeev Kumar
I am a 6th semester student pursuing CSE at IIIT Kurnool. I am deeply interested in the field of Computer Science, specially Machine Learning, Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have internship experience working in Data Science Domains.
I have undergone multiple Data science training courses and I have a deep understanding of Advanced Statistics, Machine learning and deep learning. 
I feel that Machine Learning and AI are the strongest tools that can help me achieve my dreams and hence, most of my work now revolves around this field.
